Description: >
  This template is used to deploy a simple vpc that is partitioned
  in a private and public network, with a configured NAT gateway for     
  the private network and an internet gateway for the public
  network.
  
# Resources define the entities that the template is composed of that represent
# infrastructure and services that will be deployed with the stack.

Resources:
  # VPC. This is the main component of our template, within the VPC we will be defining the subnets and
  # connect to it all components required to create the stack.

  # Subnets Definition: in this section we define the two subnets public and private
  # and also create an ElasticIP and a NAT gateway to attach it to the private network
  # so that we can have an outgoing traffic to add patches to the instances within the
  # private subnet.
