# AWS CloudFormation Adventures

This repository contains useful templates for setting up infrastructure on the AWS cloud. The templates are divided by categories and fully documented to facilitate their use and customisation. 

I have collected these templates for my own use and learning and have an easy to access location where I could quickly find them when I need to build infrastructure in AWS.

If you find them useful clone the repository and extend them!
